The project focused on developing a mini version of Bash, representing both a major challenge and the first collaborative effort for the team. 

Key objectives included:
   * Implementing a command prompt and maintaining command history.
   * Enabling file execution via the PATH variable or absolute paths.
   * Properly handling single and double quotes.
   * Supporting input and output redirection, including heredoc and append mode.
   * Implementing pipes and managing environment variables.
   * Processing exit statuses and specific key combinations (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\).
   * Recreating essential built-in commands such as echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit.
   
This project necessitated extensive learning and teamwork to successfully realize these features.
